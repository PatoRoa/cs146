For this Lab, I tried using Floyd-Marshall's. However I couldn't modify it nor be able to track it successfully to avoid it from counting imaginary paths and never changing them without affecting
the rest of the logic.
In any case, it got most of the paths right, and after calculating those, I used a counter and some logic using it that would decide which node had the least outgoing edges under the threshold.
