For this Lab, I went with using recursion to swap a binary tree's subtrees and leaves.
First, the left subtree and right subtree roots are swapped, then the recursive function is used on these roots to do the same on the subsequent leaves.

I also went with printing the original and resulting inverted tree recursively, just for testability.
