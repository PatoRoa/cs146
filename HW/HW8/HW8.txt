For this homework, after learning more about using hashes, I went with using a hash table for the Python solution, and an array for the Java solution as to count the amount of times a 
letter appears in the string, then using bitwise operations to filter out unusable letters, or other single letters after one single letter was already accounted for, and returns the 
string length of largest possible palindrome. This also works with uppercase letters.
