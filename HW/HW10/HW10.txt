For this homework, I went with using a Queue to handle the node values before putting them in a list which gets appended to a list, and then that list of lists is returned.
Essentially, a node goes into the queue, then into the list while its children are put into the queue, then they're all popped and put into the list while their children are put into the queue,
and so on.
